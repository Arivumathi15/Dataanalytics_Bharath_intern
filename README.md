**SMS Spam Classification:**
**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on the classification of SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham) using data science techniques in Python. The dataset consists of labeled SMS messages, with the goal of training a machine learning model to accurately identify and classify spam messages.

**Key Steps and Techniques:**
Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, distribution of classes, and features.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tasks such as lowercasing, removing punctuation, and handling stop words.
Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms. Common methods include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.
Model Training: Implement and train a text classification model, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or a machine learning algorithm from the scikit-learn library.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Deployment: Optionally, deploy the trained model for real-time or batch predictions.

**Titanic Survival Prediction:**
**Project Overview:**
This project aims to predict the survival status of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes information about passengers, such as age, gender, class, and ticket fare, with the goal of predicting whether a passenger survived or not.

**Key Steps and Techniques:**
Data Exploration: Explore and visualize the Titanic dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features and the survival rate.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Model Selection: Choose and train a classification model, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's hyperparameters to improve performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
Deployment: Optionally, deploy the trained model for predictions.
